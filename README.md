# GhostMunch

## About

Ghost Munch is a local multiplayer party game developed by Team XIII. In Ghost Munch all players play as ghosts in a spooky haunted mansion, where the goal is to eat as much left over food as possible! With the mansion owner recently deceased the ghosts must possess his physical body in-order to eat and satisfy their eternal hunger.

Players compete over possession of the human corpse lying dormant in the mansion. The player who completely fills their hunger meter first is the victor! Ghosts who do not have possession of the corpse must possess furniture and throw it at the possessed corpse in-order to evict the ghost inside for a chance to take the corpse for themselves!

When in control of the human corpse, the ghost must avoid other ghosts throwing furniture at them at all times, whilst finding and eating as much food as possible before they're knocked out.
